# Enigma

It was the year 2015... I wanted to self-teach me Java and I had just seen the marvelous Imitation Game... It is very rudimental but it was fun! And it works after all these years... Quite a satisfying choice Java!

I should definetely get back at this and make a tutorial at some point.

Compile bytecode:
```bash
javac -sourcepath ./src -d out Main.java
```

Run the simulation:
```bash
java -classpath ./out Main
```
